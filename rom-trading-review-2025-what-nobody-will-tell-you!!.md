## What’s ROM Trading?
ROM Trading is a smart, automated trading platform that is intended to make trading hassle- and effort-free. The ROM Trading app uses advanced algorithms and AI robots to analyze the crypto market entirely and then find the best profit opportunities.

When you’ve set up your account for automated trading, the robots will constantly be trading on your behalf. 

Once they find any good trading opportunity that they think can be profitable for you, they’ll immediately sell or buy the coin with your funds without even you doing anything. Yes, you heard that right.

Even if you’re sleeping, working in an office, spending quality time with your family, or doing any other important thing, your trading process will still be going on passively. According to the ROM Trading app, the robots on this platform make **90%** of the right automatic trades, which is a good number.

To get started with the app, you’ll just need to invest a minimum of **$250**, and you’ll be good to go.

## Tips for Beginner Traders:
Well, if you're a complete beginner, I have some tips for you that will help you make profits and keep your investments safe.

### Start Little
Don’t be too excited at the beginning and start with as little as possible. Because you’re a beginner, you’re just learning now. 

You may make some mistakes that could cost you your investment. So, if it’s too much money, then you’ll get into trouble.
### Withdraw Consistently
First-time wins are exciting, and they can motivate you to invest again right away. Traders may support this course of action, but it is recommended that you remove your earnings immediately. In this way, profits and trading capital can be distinguished clearly.
### Learn To use the Platform:
It’s always a good idea to familiarise yourself with the interface of the trading platform that you’re going to use. Also, it’s crucial for you to learn how the platform works and how you can use different options on it. This way, you’ll know what you’re doing and hence be safe.
### Associated Risks
In order to avoid a significant financial loss, we advise that you adjust the risk management settings of your robot. If you wish to bet, you may set the risk management level higher; however, it's a good idea to start slowly and increase your stakes gradually.

By following these tips, you can not only reduce the risk of losing your money but also trade efficiently as a beginner.
